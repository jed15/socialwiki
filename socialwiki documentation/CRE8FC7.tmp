\section{peers}
	peers have 6 attributes:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item id the userid of the user the peer represents
		\item	trust a number based on following relations 
		\item	likesim a percentage of how similar the peers likes are to the users
		\item	followsim a percentage of how similar the peers follows are to the users
		\item popularity percent popularity  
		\item weight an associative array of the weights of each of the 4 scores
	\end{itemize}



\section{socialwiki\_tree}
				the socialwiki\_tree is used to show the relations between pages on the history and search pages.
		the socialwiki\_tree has 1 attribute an array of socialwiki\_nodes.
		\subsection{methods}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item build\_tree: given an array of pages builds a ree by adding all the pages as nodes and calling add\_children to add the child arrays to all the nodes.
					\item add\_node: given a page adds the page as a node to the nodes array with the id being l+pageid
					\item add\_childen: goes throught the nodes array and builds the children arrays for each node
					\item sort: orgainizes the array by ordering leaves in order of priority then organizes the nodes in to a tree placing the root node first followed by its children
					\item add\_levels: goes through the array after it has been sorted and adds a level to each node root gets 1 root's child 2 etc.
					\item repos\_children: this function gets called when sorting the array and when a parent is moved it places all of the children directly after the parent in the array.
					\item
					
			\end{itemize}

\section{Peerscore Algorithm}
	The like and follow simularity for a peer are calculated using: 
		\[
		\frac{|likes (p1)\cap likes(user)|}{|likes(p1)\cup likes (user)|}
	\]
	The trust of a peer is 1 over the following distance of a peer.
	\newline
	\\Peer popularity is calculated by: 
		\[
		\frac{num\ following}{num\ peers}
	\]
	The peerscore is then calculated using:
	
		\[
		\sum score_i\times weight_i
	\]
	
	\section{pagescore}
	The page score is callculated as $(\sum peerscore)+\frac{time\ created}{current\ time} $
